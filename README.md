# Tasting Experience - Google Maps API
This project is build upon [The Tasting Experience](https://github.com/Seboeb/Code-Institute) project. At The Tasting Experience website you can book a cultural tasting for your friends or beloved ones, but sometimes you do not have the time or the money to book a tasting experience. Sometimes you just want to grab a nice drink - maybe with some delicious food - and still want a great experience for, lets say, just the midday or evening. Where do you look for such a place?

At [this](https://seboeb.github.io/CI-2nd-milestone/) separate page of The Tasting Experience website you can use Google Maps to find the perfect place that fits your needs.

## UX
This website page is focussing for users that cannot book a tasting experience, but still want to find a nice place to grab a good quality drink in a nice restaurant or other place. The user can search for a place to stay at night if he or she wants to sleep. The Google Maps API will provide the user with a graphical interface together with some filters to search for a specific area. The Google Maps API will also allow for planning a route to the selected place, including any hotels when selected.
