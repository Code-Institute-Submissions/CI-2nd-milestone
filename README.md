# Tasting Experience - Google Maps API
This project is build upon [The Tasting Experience](https://github.com/Seboeb/Code-Institute) project. At The Tasting Experience website you can book a cultural tasting for your friends or beloved ones, but sometimes you do not have the time or the money to book a tasting experience. Sometimes you just want to grab a nice drink - maybe with some delicious food - and still want a great experience for, lets say, just the midday or evening. Where do you look for such a place?

At [this](https://seboeb.github.io/CI-2nd-milestone/) separate page of The Tasting Experience website you can use Google Maps to find the perfect place that fits your needs.

## UX
This website page is focussing for users that cannot book a tasting experience, but still want to find a nice place to grab a good quality drink in a nice restaurant or other place. The user can search for a place to stay at night if he or she wants to sleep. The Google Maps API will provide the user with a graphical interface together with some filters to search for a specific area. The Google Maps API will also allow for planning a route to the selected place, including any hotels when selected.

### User stories
- As a user I want to search for bars and restaurants so that I can find a place for an alternative Tasting Experience.
- As a user I want to see customer reviews of the found bars and restaurants so that I can decide which place I will go to.
- As a user I want to be able to search in specific areas.
- As a user I can select my preferred bar or restaurant and get the corresponding contact details.
- As a user I can select if I want to search for a place to stay at the night (hotels).
- As a user I want to see what my options are to go and plan my route to the selected restaurant and hotels.
- As a user I can share my selected options with other people from the Tasting Experience website so that they can also experience my selection.

## Technologies used
This project uses several existing third party technologies to improve code quality and to speed up the development time. The following tools are used:
- **[JQuery](https://jquery.com/)**
    - JQuery makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)**
    - npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the worldâ€™s largest software registry. It will be used to manage all the javaScript dependencies used in this project.
- **[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)**
    - Webpack is a build tool that puts all of your assets, including JavaScript, images, fonts, and CSS, in a dependency graph.
- **[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)**
    - A JavaScript testing framework to test the correct behaviour of the JavaScript code.

Additionally, the following webpack modules are used:
- **node-sass, sass-loader**
    - These modules are used to convert sass or scss files to css files.
- **babel-loader, babel/core, babel/preset-env**
    - These modules are used to convert modern ES6 JavaScript files into robust ES5 JavaScript files which is supported on any browser.
- **file-loader**
- **html-webpack-plugin**
- **mini-css-extract-plugin**
